## Microbial Communities of Lake Macatawa

Welcome to the data depository for the Lake Macatawa Microbial Communities project. This is where all data, figures, figure code, and analysis code will be stored.

## Data

Our data is linked here. (Insert link to data?)

## Figure 1

Macatawa Watershed land use and sampling locations.

## Figure 2

Several measured quantities over the full three year study period. Each point represents the mean value from the four lake sites for one sampling event demonstrating that the data set in this study is both long in duration (3 years) and high in frequency (~weekly). Discharge is measured at a single USGS gauging station co-located with stream site MCR--it is used as a proxy for discharge throughout the watershed; the red line indicates baseflow as determined using the Eckhardt model[REF]. Similarly, precipitation is the mean of two NOAA rain gauges located in the watershed. The horizontal red line on the Phosphates plot represents the state of Michigan TMDL level of 50 μg/L. The horizontal red lines on the E. coli plot represent the [created by someone] daily contact limit and instant contact limit of 300 and 1000 CFU/100mL, respectively. The seasonality in lake water temperature defines the Water Temperature Season factor used throughout this work, and to color points in this figure. Note that lake phosphates show seasonal variation while lake E. coli counts do not.

## Figure 3

Box and whiskers plot of measured orthophosphate for full 3-year dataset plotted by month. Each data point represents one sample. Points are colored by water temperature season, shaped by collection year, and separated by their site type (lake or stream; WWF available in supplementary information). The black line in each box is the median and the dashed blue line is the mean. The dashed red line is the TMDL limit. For each month the number of points above and below (or equal to) the TMDL limit is shown along with the total number. If any points are not shown because they are offscale (hi or low) that is indicated on the plot.

## Figure 4

Box and whiskers plot of measured E. coli levels for full 3-year dataset plotted by month. Each data point represents one sample. Points are colored by water temperature season, shaped by collection year, and separated by their site type (lake or stream; WWF available in supplementary information). The black line in each box is the median and the dashed blue line is the mean. The dashed red lines are the ____and ____ limits. For each month the number of points above, between, and below those limits is shown (above/between/below) along with the total number. If any points are not shown because they are offscale (hi or low) that is indicated on the plot.
